This repository contains a Python-based DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) processing pipeline that processes DICOM data, corrects for motion and distortions using FSL, fits a tensor model, and generates Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD), and Axial Diffusivity (AD) maps.
